# Morse Code Encoder / Decoder

A program written in Matlab App Designer for converting Morse code messages from sound to text and from text to sound.

 The program is capable of:
  - Capturing sound from a microphone connected to the computer's sound card and interpreting it as Morse code, showing the received message both as dashes and dots and as text
  - Converting written text to Morse code in dashes and dots and outputting the message as sound.
  
The program was created for the final assignment of a Matlab course, part of the Bachelor of Engineering Physics program at the Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg.

The .mlapp binary files created by Matlab App Designer are in fact .zip files. It is possible to visualize their contents by changing the extension to .zip and extracting the files using a file decompressor.
